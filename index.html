                    <p>We know that during COVID-19, a lot of folks <br> around the city and state are feeling uneasy
                        about <br> the future - we’re not sure what the future holds <br> either.
                        <br>
                        That said: we know that we love making sure you <br> have the gear you need for your adventures,
                        and <br> we’re going to keep doing that - with our team - <br> until the city tells us we can’t.
                        <br>
                        But as long as folks like yourself support small <br> businesses around the city, then we’ll be
                        here — <br> every day, making sure your orders arrive on time.
